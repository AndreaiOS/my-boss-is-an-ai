# TODO

Running task list, per the GDD workflow. Current milestone: **M4 done → M5 — App Store launch**.

## Now

- [x] Art batch 4/5 integrated: counter backgrounds + consultant/angry client sprites
- [ ] Play a full campaign on a real device and tune the feel of the loop
- [x] M5: App Store metadata (EN+IT in docs/appstore/metadata.md), 6.9" screenshots (docs/appstore/screenshots/), PRIVACY.md, version 1.0.0, bundle id co.andreaios.mybossisanai
- [ ] M5: create app record + Game Center IDs on App Store Connect (docs/appstore/checklist.md)
- [ ] M5: TestFlight build upload (Xcode Archive)
- [ ] M5: Game Center setup in App Store Connect — enable Game Center, create leaderboard `campaigns_completed` and one achievement per ending: `ending.robots_with_feelings`, `ending.corporate_singularity`, `ending.ghost_in_the_open_space`, `ending.employee_of_the_century`, `ending.burnout_speedrun`, `ending.great_compromise`, `ending.just_another_quarter`

## Later

- [ ] M4: polish — animations, squash-and-stretch, sound gags
- [ ] M5: App Store launch prep

## Done

- [x] GDD v0.1
- [x] GitHub repository setup
- [x] `MyBossCore` Swift package: `OfficeTask`, `Consequence`, `OfficeState`, `GameEngine`, `TaskCatalog` (15 tests, TDD)
- [x] Data-driven task content (`tasks.json`, 12 tasks with gags)
- [x] Xcode project via XcodeGen (SwiftUI app + SpriteKit placeholder office scene)
- [x] Playable day loop: 3–5 tasks → Human/AI → consequence gag → day summary → campaign end
- [x] Local save/load (`save.json` in Documents, resume on launch)
- [x] M2: persistent office events (`events.json`, 7 events with thresholds), fire-once + survive save/restore
- [x] M2: campaign balance — full-AI run reaches `automated` on day 4–6, never before day 3 (test-enforced)
- [x] M2: triggered events render as persistent props in the office scene (+ fixed empty-scene rendering bug, verified via simulator screenshot)
- [x] M2: comeback events (`undoes`/`requiresAny`) — the world oscillates: Gino rehired, barista returns, memes revive (5 comeback pairs, 26 tests)
- [x] M3: 7 data-driven endings (`endings.json`), first-match-wins + exhaustive coverage test; ending screen in UI (31 tests)
- [x] M4: batch-1 pixel art integrated (backgrounds, characters, props, app icon) — sprites with nearest filtering, emoji fallback for missing art
- [x] M4: synthesized 8-bit sound gags (7 effects, `tools/make_sfx.py`), squash-and-stretch on task resolution, scene shake + haptics on events
- [x] M4: batch-2 art integrated — every event has a sprite now, no emoji fallbacks left in use
